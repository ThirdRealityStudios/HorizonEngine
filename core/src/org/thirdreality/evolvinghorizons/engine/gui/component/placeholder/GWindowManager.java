	 *  It is ensured, that all windows will have the highest priority, so they detected and rendered first before anything else during runtime.
	 *  To realize that, the layer just has the highest possible priority (see Integer.MAX_VALUE).
	 *  This is also why you can't have two window managers for the same Viewport.
	 *  It is best practice not to use multiple window managers in general in order not to have a conflict with "double priorities" later (as they are called when an IllegalArgumentException is thrown).
	 *  If you are aware of this possible error (just as described), you can of course use multiple managers..
