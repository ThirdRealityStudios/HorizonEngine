	// if you click on a button but it is unfocusable then no click will be recognized on it.
	// It is very useful to disable if you intend to ignore the priority system or the layers priorities respectively.
	// Also an example:
	// You want to put a slightly transparent GRectangle in front of a button to darken its appearance.
	// Now if you want to click the button this is normally not possible unless you tell the system not to recognize the GRectangle.
	// The thing is, the GRectangle has a higher priority than the button and it is on a different layer.
	// That means, the GRectangle is recognized first before the button even would have a "chance" to be detected.
