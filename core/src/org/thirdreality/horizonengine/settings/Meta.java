	 * This will provide all classes with a serial version ID.
	 * The serial version ID is used for several cases:
	 * - to save performance on runtime, so the JRE doesn't need to generate one.
	 * - to guarantee compatibility when serialized classes of older versions are loaded again.
	 * 		-> This will then ensure if the read class is still compatible with the latest version.
	 * 		-> For example, you save the object of a GButton on your hard-drive.
	 * 		   The save file will then contain information about the title or font size etc.
	 * 		   Now the version has changed and let's say, the font size attribute was removed lately.
	 * 		   If you would now load the file again on runtime this would result in an error
	 * 		   because the attribute from the save file does not exist anymore.
	 * 		   To avoid this ugly behavior a serial version is always specified.
	 * 		   On runtime, the file can then be checked if it is still compatible.
	 * 		   In the end this prevents undefined reactions or exceptions from the JRE and the program doesn't crash.
	 * - when there was a change and it is unknown whether the changes are still compatible with the latest version.
	 * 		-> in this the serial version will be incremented.
