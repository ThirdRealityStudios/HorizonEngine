# Horizon Engine (based on LibGDX)
A game engine especially for the needs of a basic strategy game, using an animated map.

# Project status (as of Jan 2023)
This project has not been continued for 2 years now due to school and study.
Hence, it is undone.
I originally added an algorithm to automatically calculate the UV map of any polygon (which already saves a lot of effort).
It is based on LibGDX (as mentioned) and maybe someone wants to continue the project..
